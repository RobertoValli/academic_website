Roberto Valli is a graduate student at ETH Zurich. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of St. Gallen and I am now completing my graduate education at the Center for Comparative and International Studies at ETH Zurich. After successful completion of my master's thesis I will enrol into the CIS's phd program under the supervision of Lars-Erik Cederman.
My research interests lie in the study of state and nation-formation, nationalist politics and party politics.
