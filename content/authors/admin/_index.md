I am a graduate student at ETH Zurich. I'm enrolled in the [Center for Comparative and International Studies'](https://cis.ethz.ch/Studying_CIS/PhDCIS.html) phd program under the supervision of professor [Lars-Erik Cederman](https://icr.ethz.ch/people/cederman/). I posses an M.A. degree in Comparative and International Studies from ETH Zurich and a B.A. in International Affairs from the University of St. Gallen.

My research interests cover broadly speaking both causes and consequences of the politicization of ethno-cultural traits, particularly in relation to state policy. I am interested in the study of state and nation-formation, discrimination, as well as ethnic and party politics.
