### **About me**

I am a political scientist specializing in the political economy of identity, conflict and religion. 
I am currently [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=roberto-valli) at the European University Institute. Before, I was Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. 
I was also visiting researcher at the University of Konstanz (2025), and at UC Berkeley (2022). 

I earned my PhD in 2024 in the [International Conflict Research](https://icr.ethz.ch/) group at ETH Zurich in 2024. My [dissertation](/project) studied how border change contributed to shape ethnolinguistic behavior in Europe between 1816 and 1938. 
Other projects of mine investigate the dynamics of political violence, religious politics, and public opinion. 
My research combines spatially explicit observational data and computational methods to study new (and often historical) settings with innovative research designs. My work has been published in the American Political Science Review.

I am on the academic job market this year. If you think I could be a good match for your institution, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!
