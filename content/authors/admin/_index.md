I am PhD candidate in political science at the [International Conflict Research](https://icr.ethz.ch/) group, ETH Zurich. In 2024 I will join the [Mamdhoua S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University as a postdoctoral researcher.
I was a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley's [Institute for Eastern European and Eurasian Studies](https://iseees.berkeley.edu/) during the 2022 spring semester. 

My primary research interests concern the origins and consequences of political identities at the intersection of comparative politics, historical political economy and international relations. My dissertation studies how border change contributed to shape national identities in Europe between 1816 and 1945. I rely on observational data and computational methods to measure and study nationalist and ethnic processes in new settings and with innovative research designs.
My co-authored projects study the dynamics of public opinion and religious clientelism.
