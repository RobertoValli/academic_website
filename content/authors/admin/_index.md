### **About me**

I am a political scientist studying the political economy of identity, conflict, and religion. I am currently a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=roberto-valli) at the European University Institute.

My research examines how institutions, borders, and political incentives shape ethnolinguistic behavior, political violence, and religious politics. Methodologically, I combine spatially explicit historical and contemporary data with computational methods and rigorous research designs.

My [dissertation](/project) analyzes how border change shaped ethnolinguistic behavior of book authors in Europe (1816-1938). My work has been published in the *American Political Science Review*.

I received my PhD in Political Science from ETH Zurich in 2024, then worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. I have also been a visiting researcher at the University of Konstanz (2025) and UC Berkeley (2022).

I am on the academic job market this year. If you think I could be a strong match for your institution, please feel free to get in touch!
