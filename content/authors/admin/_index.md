I am PhD candidate in political science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Lars-Erik Cederman](https://icr.ethz.ch/people/cederman/). 
In 2022 I visited UC Berkeley's [Institute for Eastern European and Eurasian Studies](https://iseees.berkeley.edu/). 

My main research interests concern the origins and consequences of mass identities and political behavior based on inherited traits, such as language and religion. My dissertation studies how border changes and war contributed to the formation of national identities in 19th century Europe.
In other co-authored projects, I study the dynamics of public opinion. I rely on observational data and computational methods to measure and study nationalist and ethnic processes in new settings and with innovative research designs.
