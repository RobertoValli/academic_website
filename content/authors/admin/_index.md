I am PhD candidate in political science at the [International Conflict Research](https://icr.ethz.ch/) group, ETH Zurich. 
In 2022 I visited UC Berkeley's [Institute for Eastern European and Eurasian Studies](https://iseees.berkeley.edu/). 

My main research interests concern the origins and consequences of political identities. My dissertation studies how border change and war contributed to the formation of national identities in Europe. I rely on observational data and computational methods to measure and study nationalist and ethnic processes in new settings and with innovative research designs.
In co-authored projects, I also study the dynamics of public opinion and religious clientelism.
