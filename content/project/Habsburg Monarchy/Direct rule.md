### PhD project. 

As the core theme of my dissertation, I am interested in how internal governance evolved in the transition from traditional forms of rule to the nation-state. Nation-states justify their existence by claiming representation of a "core nation," as opposed to the varied repertoires of dynastic or theocratic legitimization of empires and city-states. 

Among the consequences of this trasnformation of statehood, I want to focus on the allocation of state resources to ethnic groups, the electoral response of the enfranchised masses, and the violent consequences of systematic ethnic exclusion.
