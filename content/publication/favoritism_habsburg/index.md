### Master's Thesis

Recent scholarship as hypothesized that ethnic favoritism might be a "axiom of politics."
In my thesis I question this generalization and explore whether ethnic favoritism is rather intrinsically linked to nation-states.

I compare patterns of railway construction in the two halves of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1855 to 1901. I show that in the Austrian territories, which were ruled in traditional imperial fashion, there is little or no sign of ethnic favoritism. On the other hand, the construction of railways in Hungary is such that Magyars enjoy disproportionately short traveling times to Budapest.
