We argue that European integration challenges the nation-state, a form of statehood grants the highest status and the most opportunities to the country's titular nation. We test this rather simple, and yet largely overlooked intuition using multiple rounds of the European Social Survey and the International Social Survey."

abstract: Why are minority individuals particularly in favor of supranational integration? We argue that European integration challenges the nation-state, a form of statehood grants the highest status and the most opportunities to the country's titular nation. It therefore possesses a strong normative appeal for national minority groups. In particular, we hypothesize that minority individuals have stronger support for European integration than the ``core nationals.'' We test this rather simple, and yet largely overlooked intuition using multiple rounds of the European Social Survey and the International Social Survey. Our empirical strategy relies on coarsened exact matching to identify suitable counterfactuals between minority and majority individuals. Results indicate a robust positive effect of minority status -- operationalized as ethnic and linguistic traits, and parents' orgins -- on support for European integration. The effect is robust to various specifications and EU support items. We show that among two sets of countries with peculiar dynamics of ethnic politics, that is states with large Russian minorities and multinational states with formal power-sharing arrangements, majority-minority differences in EU support work differently yet in a way entirely compatible with our theory. Altogether, our contribution demonstrates the relevance of both recent and historical minorities in EU politics, and how one's evaluation of a political system depends on contextual judgments about ethnic biases.
