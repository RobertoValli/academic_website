The revival of national communities is a defining feature of nineteenth and twentieth-century European politics. National revivals are the result of cultural agents developing and promoting the culture of an ethnic group, most importantly through the production of scientific and educational literature. The work of cultural nationalists was crucial for politicization and indoctrination of mass public, in a period when popular attitudes started having political weight. Moreover, scholars have highlighted how cultural revivals often precede more consequential political manifestations of nationalism. However, so far there has been almost no effort to systematically measure and explain cultural nationalism with quantitative data. This paper introduces a new comprehensive and spatially-explicit dataset of book publications in Europe between 1750 and 1945 to measure cultural nationalism. Book publication data allows to precisely locate cultural nationalism in space and time, and thus to model the determinants of national revivals. In particular, this paper evaluates the role of internal and international conflict and political exclusion in the development of high culture among European language groups. Thereby, it contributes to the debate on the origins of nationalism, and on the conditions under which nations develop collective action.
